# Hadoop-Performance-Comparison-Project
This project is to compare performance between a Hadoop DFS and a Centralized File System. From the lab experiment results, we try to find the inflection point by which Hadoop will obtain better performance than single machine. 

Purpose:
--------
This project has already done before. There are even 305 downloads by people who are interested in Hadoop from 2/13/2017 to 10/12/2017. The reason should be the code that I attached on my paper so that people can directly use it, but it's picture code format. For more convenient use, I create this repo to attach my code here so that people can download code from here directly.
