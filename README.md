# Hadoop Performance Comparison Project
This project is to compare performance between a Hadoop DFS and a Centralized File System. From the lab experiment results, we try to find the inflection point by which Hadoop will obtain better performance than single machine. 

Purpose:
--------
This project has already done before. There are even 305 downloads by people who are interested in Hadoop from 2/13/2017 to 10/12/2017. The reason should be the code that I attached on my paper so that people can directly use it, but it's picture code format. For more convenient use, I create this repo to attach my code here so that people can download code from here directly.

Paper topic:
------------
Performance Comparison of a Hadoop DFS to a Centralized File System of a Single Machine

Notes:
------
   1) About Hadoop sort code, this is the optimized one. If you need to check the version before optimizing, please check the paper.
   2) If anyone finds any difference between this code version and the paper code version, FOLLOW the paper version.
